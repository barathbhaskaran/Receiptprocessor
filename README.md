# Receiptprocessor
A Receipt Processing API that takes in JSON receipts, processes them to award points based on specific rules, and allows users to retrieve the points associated with each receipt via a RESTful API. It supports in-memory storage for receipt data, without requiring persistent databases. This application also has a docker container that we can use to install the server in local environment easily.
